# Formula Exercise XBlock Modernization Notes

This document summarizes the modernization work applied to the Formula Exercise XBlock.

## Key Changes
- Python 2 -> Python 3 migration (syntax, iteritems -> items, unicode removal).
- Added ScorableXBlockMixin; implemented score persistence via submissions API (optional) or local fields.
- Made MySQL dependency optional via guarded db_service usage.
- Replaced deprecated ResourceLoader.render_template with render_django_template.
- Added per-expression feedback in student submission handler (expression_results & overall_feedback).
- Fixed cexprtk encoding bug (removed unnecessary .encode on formulas; added defensive decoding of bytes).
- Updated front-end JS to use JSON AJAX, render feedback, and handle errors.
- Added CSS for feedback styling.
- Guarded xmodule-dependent deletion handler import for Workbench compatibility.

## Testing
Existing legacy tests updated (iteritems -> items, relative imports). Additional tests recommended for:
- student_submit handler end-to-end (mock submissions API).
- Feedback correctness when some expressions wrong.
- Score computation edge cases (max_attempts logic).

## Next Steps
- Add pytest-based test suite & GitHub Actions CI.
- Consider accessibility enhancements (aria-live region for feedback).
- Implement partial credit if needed.
