// To do: solve the overlapping of the canvas and the xblock info from workbench

Main To do:

# 1. a logic in which the student draws and after the submit button is clicked, the student is graded based on  the question asked (question must be changed into type of drawing and coordinates) and the json file of drawing-- not difficult to do. This one doesn't require saving student's work so is easier

# 2. way of doing #1 and saving the entire .json file so that it can populate the student's work

# 3. Do this once or twice per week for specific hours; shouldn't take most of my time
