# This project is cloned from : git clone https://github.com/naeem91/xblock-mcqs.git

It is a simple xblock to my liking because it has default mc questions and more importantly it is "editable" in the studio

It also shows the selected choice in green if correct and red if incorrect; along the correct answer in green

# For me todo:

to be gradable and being able to be sent to 'lms' grade center; which is I think tweeking the .py file;


# Commites:

git commit -m "commited on 8/24/2024: workable one on this date. Will fall back to this if improvement fails; the only thing missing is grade being sent to lms grade center"
