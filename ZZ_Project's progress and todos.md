1. The crucial thing is to send data from the frontend (what the user drew) to the backend (what is to be processed, checked and graded) and then message is sent back to the frontend.

2. Build the studioView so that you can edit all the fields (understand the basic xblock-react which has a working editable field and myxblock which has more fields and work well in openedx instance and then you can make the modification for the drawing studioView which is not working) --- > To the most part, the studioview edit is working but is throwing error. When "Save" button, it seems that html is sent instead of json file to the backend; so we need to fix that
