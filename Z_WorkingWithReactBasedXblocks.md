# Editing the React frontend code
The main file for the XBlock's user interface is react_xblock_2/frontend/src/react_xblock_2.tsx. But in order to edit this file, you will first have to install the required Node packages and start the frontend compiler:

cd xblock-react/react_xblock_2/frontend/
npm install
npm run watch

cd xblock-myxblock/myxblock/frontend/
npm install
npm run watch
